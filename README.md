# Pokemon-Game
This is the Pok√©mon game for our project

**How to Use** 

The user will be directed to the main website at https://pokemon-game.aidencizek.repl.co/ 

From here, you'll be able to start playing the game. 
The links at the top side bar allow you to access various aspects from the game. 

**Starters**

Clicking on this will take the user to the starters section of the page automatically. This will allow the user to see which pokemon they would like to start the game with. They have 3 choices: 

[1] Bulbasaur - a grass type pokemon. 
[2] Charmander - a fire type pokemon. 
[3] Squirtle - a water type pokemon. 

**Pokedex**

The Pokedex will take you to the index of all the pokemon in the game, and will give you a detailed information on the pokemon, including its moves, power, abilites, type, weaknesses and strengths, as well as its evolutionary stages.
